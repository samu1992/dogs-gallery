## Web App Demo
This is a web app project created to demonstrate my skills in React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. The app utilizes an API to display images and implement a carousel feature.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app's functionality.

Edit the app/page.js file to make changes to the page. The page will auto-update as you modify the file.
This project also utilizes next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
